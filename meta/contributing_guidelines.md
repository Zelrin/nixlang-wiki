# Contributing guidelines

Welcome to nixlang.wiki, potential contributor!

## Creating Articles

When creating articles, please only use the markdown editor for now. This is in part because we wanna ensure that we have a mostly homogenous formatting across the wiki.

Further this also makes it easier to read the plaintext for people browsing via the git repo.

## Moderation

We expect every contributor to follow the [code_of_conduct](/meta/code_of_conduct) on all of nixlang.wiki and the various spaces where we develop it.

## Hacking

Do you have some software related idea? Do you want membership in the github organization, or to move your project to it?
