## Why the new wiki?
Well, for starters, our understanding is that https://nixos.wiki isn't getting updated anymore. We've heard various rumors about the reasons for this being the case, and while we find them concerning, we'd feel it was in bad taste to share them publicly. 

Suffice to say, it seems necessary to create a new active wiki.

Part of our goals is also to make this wiki easy to fork, which is why we keep a git repo of all articles. This is to help make the wiki less centralized, and more independent.

Further, we'd like to create a broader wiki, and we'd like to open it up to projects that share our values (see [project category explanation](/projects/info) for more).
